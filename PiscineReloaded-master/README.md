# PiscineReloaded

Piscine Reloaded is a series of simple shell and C exercises taken from the Piscine, the 1-month coding marathon that serves as a selection process for 42. The aim of the exercises is to give the student a basic understanding of the architecture of C code, of strings, pointers, memory, iterative and recursive function, and other basic concepts.

Complete instructions can be found in the *resources* folder.

I finished these exercises in November 2018.

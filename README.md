## 📚 **Shell Exercises**

This section contains my **Shell exercises** from the **42 Piscine**, where I learned to master:
- Unix shell basics
- File manipulation
- Shell scripting

Each exercise helped me deepen my understanding of the powerful Unix shell environment, from simple commands to more complex scripts.

## 💻 **C Programming Exercises**

The **C Programming** section showcases my journey through the C language, covering core concepts such as:
- **Control structures**: Loops, conditions
- **Data structures**: Arrays, strings, and pointers
- **Functions**: Creating and manipulating user-defined functions

### **Progress Overview**:
- **C00 to C05 Exercises**: Comprehensive solutions focusing on fundamental C programming skills.
- **Completion up to C02**: The majority of exercises up to C02 are complete, demonstrating proficiency in key topics such as arrays, conditions, and loops.

## 🚀 **Rush Projects**

**Rush projects** are weekend-long sprints where we tackle challenging problems under tight deadlines. These projects test not only our coding skills but also our ability to manage stress and work efficiently under pressure.

- **Rush00**: This project is fully completed and functions as intended.
- **Rush02**: This project is partially completed, with room for improvement, but still offers valuable insights and learning opportunities.

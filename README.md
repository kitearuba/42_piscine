# 🏊‍♂️ **42 Piscine Repository**

Welcome to my **42 Piscine Repository**! This repository contains various exercises and projects that I completed during my time at the 42 coding school. Below, you'll find an overview of the contents, including shell exercises, C programming exercises, rush projects, and more.

## 📚 **Contents**

### 🐚 **Shell Exercises**
This section contains all of my **shell exercises** from the 42 Piscine. These exercises helped me become familiar with the Unix shell, covering:
- Basic commands
- Shell scripting
- File manipulation

### 💻 **C Programming Exercises**
Here you'll find my solutions for the C programming exercises. Below is a brief summary of the progress:
- **C Exercises up to C5:** These exercises include basic programming concepts such as loops, conditions, arrays, and functions.
- **Mostly completed up to C2:** Most of the exercises up to C2 are done, showcasing fundamental skills in C programming.

### 🚀 **Rush Projects**
The **Rush Projects** are intensive coding challenges typically spanning over a weekend. These projects are designed to test our ability to work under pressure and deliver functional software in a short time frame.
- **Rush00:** Completed perfectly and fully functional.
- **Rush02:** Partially completed but still a valuable learning experience.

### 📂 **Subjects Folder**
The repository includes a `subjects` folder that contains most of the subject PDFs. These documents provide detailed instructions and requirements for each exercise and project.

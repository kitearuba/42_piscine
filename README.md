# 42 Piscine Repository

Welcome to my 42 Piscine repository! This repository contains various exercises and projects that I completed during my time at the 42 coding school. Below, you'll find an overview of what is included in this repository.

## Contents

### Shell Exercises
This section contains all the shell exercises from the 42 Piscine. These exercises helped me get familiar with the Unix shell, including basic commands, scripting, and file manipulation.

### C Exercises
Here, you'll find my solutions for the C exercises. The progress is as follows:
- **C Exercises up to C5:** The exercises include basic programming concepts such as loops, conditions, arrays, and functions.
- **Mostly completed up to C2:** Most exercises up to C2 are thoroughly done, showcasing fundamental C programming skills.

### Rush Projects
Rush projects are intensive coding exercises that typically span over a weekend. They are designed to test our ability to work under pressure and deliver working software within a short time frame.
- **Rush00:** This project is completed perfectly.
- **Rush02:** This project is partially completed but not entirely successful.

### Subjects Folder
Included in this repository is a folder named `subjects` containing most of the subject PDFs. These documents provide detailed instructions and requirements for each exercise and project.
